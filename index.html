        <h1>From The Labyrinth</h1>
        <p class="landing-text">
          Composed of the French violinist Fay Guiffo and the pianist Chris
          Lyons, From The Labyrinth brings the lost tradition of classical music
          improvisation back to life. They push the boundaries of the ritualised
          experience of the concert hall, exploring the evocative power of
          movement and words, immersing their audience into a lively and poetic
          space.
