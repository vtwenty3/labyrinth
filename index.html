        <h1>From The Labyrinth</h1>
        <p class="landing-text">
          Composed of the French violinist Fay Guiffo and the pianist Chris
          Lyons, From The Labyrinth brings the lost tradition of classical music
          improvisation back to life. They push the boundaries of the ritualised
          experience of the concert hall, exploring the evocative power of
          movement and words, immersing their audience into a lively and poetic
          space.

        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <p>
          Our work is the return of a lost tradition, a call for bringing back
          to life what was once was, but born anew for these times. From Bach to
          Liszt, classical musicians and famous composers would play spontaneous
          music to their audience, improvising upon themes or conjuring entire
          pieces into being in the moment. It was once expected that all great
          performers or composers were also improvisers. Our project 'From The
          Labyrinth' brings this tradition back to life but in a new way.
          Incorporating music, movement, words, theatricality and a sense of the
          mysterious and of the divine, we create a completely unique concert
          experiences in which every moment is suffused with new creation and
          new worlds and possibilities dance in the instance of imagining.
